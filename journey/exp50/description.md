## exp50 — exp35 recipe on `photo2anime_3k`

**Status: WIRED 2026-05-16**

First test of the data scale-up. Same recipe as legacy exp35 (minimal
aug, exp35 arch = decoder_attn + pyramid + FiLM, constant LPIPS=0.2,
20k @ 256px bs=4) but training data is the 3k merged dataset. Two
stacking effects expected:

1. **3.2× more data** → lifts the architecture/recipe ceiling that
   capped every legacy exp33-49 at lpips_sq ≈ 0.124.
2. **Real photo sources finally in training** → model stops being OOD
   on real-photo inference. Probably the bigger visual lift; metrics
   alone may understate it.

Validates twice at end (`--wandb-resume` so both go to the same wandb
run under separate prefixes):
- `--split val` on legacy 100 group photos (continuity with prior runs)
- `--split val_portraits` on 200 FFHQ portraits (face-quality signal)

**Results (2026-05-16, done)**:

| split | metric | value |
|---|---|---|
| val (legacy) | lpips_sq / lpips_vgg / ssim | 0.150 / 0.297 / 0.516 |
| val (legacy) | face_lpips_sq / face_lpips_vgg / face_ssim | 0.201 / 0.379 / 0.605 |
| **val_portraits** | **lpips_sq / lpips_vgg / ssim** | **0.170 / 0.353 / 0.444** |
| **val_portraits** | **face_lpips_sq / face_lpips_vgg / face_ssim** | **0.124 / 0.285 / 0.544** |
| val_portraits | Δ lpips_vgg / Δ lpips_sq | **+0.037 / +0.024** |

**val_portraits face_lpips_sq=0.124 is the lowest face metric we've ever
measured** (vs exp25-80k's 0.169 baseline). −27% on the meaningful
face-quality signal. Two predicted effects landed exactly:

1. **Data scale-up** lifted the ceiling that capped every legacy
   exp33-49 around lpips_sq=0.124 on the easier legacy val.
2. **Real-source domain finally in training** closed both the quality
   gap on real portraits AND — unexpectedly — the corruption-robustness
   gap, all without any explicit corruption aug. Δ lpips_vgg dropped
   from exp25's +0.116 to **+0.037**, comparable to exp32-100k's
   corruption-trained +0.040. Real-photo training inherently exposes
   the model to natural-image statistics that the corrupt-from-synth
   recipe was trying to simulate.

**Legacy val regression** (lpips_sq 0.124→0.150 vs exp35) is expected
and fine — different source distribution. Not the right signal.

**Implication**: data was the lever the whole time. Architecture work
(exp34-39, 42-49, 7+ runs in the legacy era) collectively moved
face_lpips_sq by ~0, while one data swap moved it by 27%.
